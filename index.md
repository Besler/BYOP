## Bring Your Own Paper (BYOP) Reading Group

> Give me your tired, your poor,  
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,  
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,  
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

From *The New Colossus* by Emma Lazarus.

This reading group is for the papers yearning to breathe free.
Bring those papers and discuss them with like minded individuals.
Topics include physics, chemistry, and biology, but can be extended by an interested individual.

### Organization
This group is ran by David Garrett (CalTech) and Bryce Besler (Calgary).
An hour is scheduled as the maximum time for the meeting.
The presenter is free to use that time however they please.
If you need a prescribed format, we recommend 20 minutes of presentation and 20 minutes of discussion, with prepared slides.
It is generally not expected that the audience has read the paper before hand, but the paper is shared before hand for those interested.
Politics is strictly off topic.
We hope to curate a vibe of "momentous and gleeful curiosity".

### Expected Background
Generally, attendees should have some knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology as well as superficial knowledge of PDEs and vector calculus.
If math is needed to describe a topic, it is encouraged, but it should not be a crutch.
